# License Strategy for AUI-Core and AUI-TK

## Author and Copyright
Both **AUI-Core** and **AUI-TK** are authored and maintained by the same copyright holder (**CoPiCo2Co**).  
As the sole rights holder, the author retains the ability to license these projects under different terms.

## License Choices
- **AUI-Core** is released under **GPLv3**.  
- **AUI-TK** is released under **LGPLv3**.  

Even if AUI-TK interacts with AUI-Core at runtime, it may still be licensed under LGPLv3, because both projects are under the control of the same copyright holder. This avoids the usual "GPL-upgrade" effect that would otherwise apply if two independently licensed projects were combined.

## Dual Licensing
Both projects may also be made available under commercial licenses.  
Contributors acknowledge (via CONTRIBUTING.md) that the maintainer retains the right to relicense their contributions for commercial use.

## Contributions
To ensure continued flexibility, all external contributions must:
1. Be original work or legally contributable by the author.  
2. Be licensed under the same terms as the project (GPLv3 for AUI-Core, LGPLv3 for AUI-TK).  
3. Grant the maintainer the right to additionally license the contribution under other terms (e.g. commercial).

This requirement is documented in each project's CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Summary
- AUI-Core → GPLv3 (or commercial license).  
- AUI-TK → LGPLv3 (or commercial license).  
- Dual licensing remains possible, since all rights are held by the same maintainer.  
- Contributions from third parties are accepted only with licensing terms that preserve this flexibility.
